            Our Plans for the Growth and Visibility of NAUS
        </p>
        <p>
            As a candidate for the position of Publicity Secretary under the National Association of University Students (NAUS), I present my vision of inclusivity, collaboration, and strategic growth that will elevate NAUS to new heights. Together, we will create a stronger, more visible, and impactful association for all students in Oyo State.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Collaboration Between Campuses:</strong>
